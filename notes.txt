Last time there was too much randomness. Basically my expectation was, I'll create a game with a non-obvious solution, and the genetic algorithm will figure it out. This time I want to do the opposite. I want to create a game where the solution may be somewhat obvious and the challenge is to get the algo to find it. Some ideas:

Starting at level 10, the player is offered a "Fire Immunity" passive power. Starting at level 15, and every X levels thereafter, the player will take 5-10 fire damage per turn.
-> Obvious solution: take the passive at level 14 (before this it has no value, after this it's almost required)

Starting at some level, monsters will start doing a multi-attack where they hit 10 times for 2 damage. At some point the player is offered a damage reduction passive which makes this survivable.

At level 20, the player encounters the first boss, which has wayyy more health. Sometime before this, they're offered some kind of Demon Form/Noxious Fumes type passive or card that will allow them to scale in longer combats.

Trap floors - introduce floors where the player has a few "choices" to evade massive damage (50) from a trap. If they have 5+ dex, they can dodge. 5+ str, keep the thing from falling or whatever. Otherwise maybe they can sacrifice their best card?

Daze type challenge - the player starts receiving junk cards in their deck. If they haven't taken some kind of Dark Embrace/Feel no pain type effect, this overwhelms them.

Again, the idea isn't to make a game that would be "fun" for a real player. Keep it relatively deterministic. Passive abilities that are always offered at certain floors are great for this.
